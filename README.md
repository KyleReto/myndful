# The Book of the DSS

### Description
This site is the central place to view any of the numerous quotes from the illustrious DSS and its brilliant members. Just click the button and see what you find.

### Project goals
The site should be a fun little site to entertain someone (mainly other DSS members) for a few minutes, ideally. It should be quick and entertaining, presenting the best quotes from the DSS in a snappy and snazzy way. Or, you know, as snappy and snazzy as a couple of college kids and one home server can allow. The main interaction method is finding a random quote, but the user should be able to peruse through the quotes in order or search for a specific quote from its content, ideally.

### Running the site
To run the site, grab a terminal of your choice and Node.js. Then, in that terminal, navigate to the site's folder. Install any necessary packages (try `npm ci`), and run app.js via node (`node app.js`). From there, the site should be accessible at `localhost:3000` in your web browser by default.

### Configuring the site
Check out the config.js file. You can edit the various configurable variables from there.
